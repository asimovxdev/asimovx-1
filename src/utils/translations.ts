How do you prototype your deep learning models in a quick, yet elegant way? The answer is carried around in our very pockets. Smartphones. That’s right.

Combine the ubiquitous nature of smartphones and the versatile technology that is machine learning and you’re looking at a vast potential of innovation right there.",

So, at one such instance, the matter of deployment loomed ahead of me and I had to choose between the daunting world of native android development and an exciting, yet uncharted new tech called Flutter. I chose the latter. At the time of writing this article, not every aspect of flutter is super stable, but it is certain that all of those problems shall disappear. In this article, I shall describe the important aspects of integrating deep learning models into an android app made with flutter.

This was understandable as it was an in-browser application and so, I decided to port the code to mighty Python. A few sessions of research showed me that they were using Posenet, a fast yet accurate model, for estimating pose.",
                    p5: "The Objective was simple: I wanted to go one step ahead and compare a whole action such as a punch or a kick with an image and tell me the extend to which it was correct.",

It matches the different troughs and crests in a graph using one to many matching and such, resulting in synced up frames on its own.",
                    p_dtw_2: "This method seemed ideal for my use case, as I had similar graphs for each of the 17 key-points as the action was performed.

It is even rumored that flutter will soon be the go-to name in mobile app development. Creating UIs is a breeze and the developer friendly coding style makes the icing on the cake.",
                    p4: "Working as an AI engineer, one of the most common problems I and my team mates encounter is the matter of deployment of our models. How do you prototype your deep learning models in a quick, yet elegant way? The answer is carried around in our very pockets. Smartphones. That’s right. That overpowered piece of hardware on which you are possibly reading this article at this very moment is any developer’s dream come true. Combine the ubiquitous nature of smartphones and the versatile technology that is machine learning and you’re looking at a vast potential of innovation right there.",
                    p5: "Now, I work at a place where people are often expected to roll up their sleeves and get the job done rather than wait for help. So, at one such instance, the matter of deployment loomed ahead of me and I had to choose between the daunting world of native android development and an exciting, yet uncharted new tech called Flutter. I chose the latter. At the time of writing this article, not every aspect of flutter is super stable, but it is certain that all of those problems shall disappear. In this article, I shall describe the important aspects of integrating deep learning models into an android app made with flutter. While I am no experienced android nor flutter developer, I was able to get a base version working in about a week. That’s how easy it is.",

If you are unfamiliar with what I just mentioned a few beginner posts will get you on your way.

                    p2: "Making a smartphone app from scratch might seem a daunting task to most newbies and maybe even seasoned programmers. Enter Flutter.",
                    p3: "As One of the promising, albeit untested technologies unveiled by Google for android app development, Flutter aims to make smartphone app development easier than ever. It is even rumored that flutter will soon be the go-to name in mobile app development. Creating UIs is a breeze and the developer friendly coding style makes the icing on the cake.",
                    p4: "Working as an AI engineer, one of the most common problems I and my team mates encounter is the matter of deployment of our models. How do you prototype your deep learning models in a quick, yet elegant way? The answer is carried around in our very pockets. Smartphones. That’s right. That overpowered piece of hardware on which you are possibly reading this article at this very moment is any developer’s dream come true. Combine the ubiquitous nature of smartphones and the versatile technology that is machine learning and you’re looking at a vast potential of innovation right there.",
                    p5: "Now, I work at a place where people are often expected to roll up their sleeves and get the job done rather than wait for help. So, at one such instance, the matter of deployment loomed ahead of me and I had to choose between the daunting world of native android development and an exciting, yet uncharted new tech called Flutter. I chose the latter. At the time of writing this article, not every aspect of flutter is super stable, but it is certain that all of those problems shall disappear. In this article, I shall describe the important aspects of integrating deep learning models into an android app made with flutter. While I am no experienced android nor flutter developer, I was able to get a base version working in about a week. That’s how easy it is.",
                    p6: "I assume the reader has a base understanding of layouts in flutter and a basic understanding of the programming language used, which is Dart. If you are unfamiliar with what I just mentioned a few beginner posts will get you on your way. While the methods and code mentioned in this project is not exactly what I would call optimized, it can serve as a starting point or a base for your own projects. So let’s dive in to it.",

I chose the latter. At the time of writing this article, not every aspect of flutter is super stable, but it is certain that all of those problems shall disappear. In this article, I shall describe the important aspects of integrating deep learning models into an android app made with flutter.
